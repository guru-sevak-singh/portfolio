                marks, and store important documents.
                With dedicated dashboards and real-time reporting, it improves transparency, saves time, and reduces
                paperwork.

                <p>
                    The system includes a secure login view to ensure that only authorized users
                    (students, teachers, and admins) can access their profiles.
                    Authentication prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive school data.

                <p>
                    The system makes it easy to create and manage class timetables.
                    It automatically checks teacher availability and assigns classes to free teachers,
                    ensuring there are no conflicts and saving time in manual scheduling.

                <p>
                    The system allows schools to track subject details according to each class and academic year.
                    If a student continues in the same school for multiple years, all subject information across their
                    entire academic journey
                    can be accessed with a single click, directly from the student’s profile page.
                    This ensures complete academic history management in one place.

                <h3>School Management System Project</h3>
                <p>
                    Our School Management System was successfully developed and capable of running smoothly.
                    Working on this project helped us gain valuable insights into large databases and complex mapping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, despite its functionality, the project had to be stopped due to low adoption.
                    Most users preferred traditional paper-based methods and manual boards over an online portal.
                    Conflicts and differing priorities also made it difficult to continue the project long-term.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system once ran successfully and demonstrated our capability to handle large-scale educational
                    software projects.
