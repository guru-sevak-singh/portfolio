            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>TheOpenTable</strong> is a web application designed to simplify restaurant and theatre order
                management.
                It provides an end-to-end solution for taking online and in-seat orders, monitoring sales, and tracking
                delivery status.
                Customers can place orders directly from their seats using QR codes or even opt for home delivery.
                On the other side, restaurant staff get a clean dashboard to manage tables, monitor payment status, and
                track order progress in real-time.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Features -->

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ <strong>Multi-bank account support</strong> – each theatre or outlet can connect its own bank
                    account rather than sharing a single payment gateway.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Order tracking</strong> – real-time updates for pending, in-progress, and completed
                    orders.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>QR-based ordering</strong> – customers can scan a QR at their seat/table to order food or
                    request home delivery.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Table status management</strong> – see whether a table is vacant, awaiting delivery, or
                    has pending payments at a glance.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Simple dashboard</strong> – intuitive layout for staff to view all tables, orders, and
                    payments clearly.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Order profiles</strong> – track individual orders with details about items, amount, and
                    customer.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Payment tracking</strong> – see all payments received and pending in one place.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Delivery module</strong> – customers provide their details (name, address, phone) for home
                    delivery orders, ensuring smooth communication.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>
                    A secure login system ensures that only registered restaurants can access their dashboard.
                    After logging in, restaurant owners and staff can manage their menu, process orders,
                    track payments, and view reports.
                    This authentication step protects sensitive restaurant data and prevents unauthorized access.

                <h3>Restaurant Management System Project</h3>
                <p>
                    The Restaurant Management System was an innovative project designed to streamline operations and
                    improve efficiency.
                    It had a strong concept and promising features that could benefit restaurants of all sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite its potential, the project faced tough competition from established players in the market.
                    Most local users were already accustomed to existing products, which made adoption slow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After giving it time and effort, we decided to conclude the project.
                    The experience, however, provided valuable lessons in market dynamics, product positioning, and user
                    preferences.
                    The project’s website has now been closed, but the insights gained will guide our future endeavors.
